# Introduction

Creating a SQL table seems not really complicated, but in fact all SQL engine have specific stuffs (keyword, supported syntax, ...).
I decided to try to generate SQL statement for SQL table creation from a schema described in Lua.

## The Goal

Setup the database backend name, got the statement to create my table :-D

# Status

Still in development

# TODO

 * testsuite
 * found a better name ?
 * ...

# License

I follow the same than luasql : MIT License.
